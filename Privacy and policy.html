     <h1 id="pk">About The Website</h1>
     <h2>Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a corporate website for a
          company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, 
          ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively
           constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically part of an 
           intranet.</h2>
    <h1  id="pk">What We Do Here</h1>
    <h2>Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.

            Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. 
            Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis
             statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. 
             An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate
              to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which 
              serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.</h2>
    <h1  id="pk">About Cookies</h1>
    <h2>If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with
         malware.<br>

        If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for
         misconfigured or infected devices.<br>Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of 
         code so they cannot be executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to 
         other networks to execute and replicate again. Since they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard 
         virus definition.</h2>
