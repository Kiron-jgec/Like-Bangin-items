    <h2>Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a corporate website for a 
        company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose,
         ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively 
         constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically part of an 
         intranet.</h2>
        <h1  id="pk">Our Aim</h1>
        <h2>Policies of privatisation should be considered as responses to several distinct pressures. First, privatisation is a response
             by the state to internal forces such as increasing fiscal problems (O’Connor, 1973). It provides a means of lessening the 
             state’s fiscal responsibilities by encouraging the development of private alternatives which, theoretically at least, do not
              draw upon the state’s financial reserves. Second, the promotion of private sector activity is a response to pressures 
              originating ‘outside’ the state apparatus. These include demands from people who see a large state bureaucracy as inefficient 
              and wasteful, demands from business interests who claim that they can overcome these inefficiencies, and pressures from 
              client groups who seek to reduce their dependency on the welfare state by having more control over the services on which 
              they depend. Clearly, this variety of calls for privatisation means that it is not a process with a uniform outcome; there
               exists a correspondingly wide variety of forms of privatisation.</h2>
